# Pre-Assingment for Reagle

The results are displayed in [results.ipynb](https://github.com/serveri24h/reagle_pre_assignment/blob/main/results.ipynb) file. The cells are populted so the code does not require running.

The results can replicated easily as well. The following dependencies are required:
* Pythnon 3
    * pandas
    * sqlite3
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

The code is executed as
```
./run
```
or alternatively
```
bash run
```
or
```
jupyter notebook results.ipynb
```
