# Pre-Assingment for Reagle

### The results are displayed in [results.ipynb](https://github.com/serveri24h/reagle_pre_assignment/blob/main/results.ipynb) file. The cells are pre-populated so no code needs to be ran to observe the results.

### If interested, 
The results can be replicated easily as well. The following dependencies are required:
* Python3
    * pandas
    * sqlite3
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook



The code can executed in linux, os x or any unix based shell environment as follows:
```
./run
```

or alternatively
```
bash run
```

Another alternative if something goes wrong is to create the database folder manually and run the jupyter notebook
```
mkdir databases
jupyter notebook results.ipynb
```
